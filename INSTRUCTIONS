To play the game, simply launch it by running main.java, then press the "Start Game" button.

Once there, you and the other player will take turns selecting open spaces in the tic-tac-toe field to try and connect 3 in a row in any direction, and within 5 seconds per turn. The first person to do so wins!

If the game draws (all the available spaces are filled and nobody has won yet) just restart the game!

To restart the game at any time, just press the "Restart Game" button in the game screen.

Feel free to exit the game screen and return to the homepage as well by pressing the "escape" button  on your keyboard. Have fun!
