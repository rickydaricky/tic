## Primary Requirements:
| Requirement | Location in code or steps to view in game  |
|---|---|
| Your handin must meet all global requirements | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| Your handin only crashes under exceptional circumstances (edge cases) | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| Your engine must draw the current screen on every “draw” event (originating from support code). Each screen must be able to define the way in which it is drawn independently from other screens | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| Your engine must be able to process mouse events (originating from support code) and allow each screen to define how they are handled | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| Your engine must be able to process keyboard events (originating from the support code) and allow each screen to define how they are handled | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| Your current screen must update itself on every “tick” event (originating from the support code) | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| Your engine must be able to process resizable windows (originating from support code) and adjust the internal state when the draw area is resized. It must also ensure that size information is preserved when the current screen changes – if the current screen changes after a resize event, the new current screen must be aware of the correct window size as well | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| Your engine should have a basic UI toolkit. At a minimum, this toolkit should allow a game to display text and rectangles | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| Your engine must have a correct and easily extensible implementation of a button | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| Your handin must meet all playtesting requirements | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| A 3x3 square board must be accessible from the screen once the application is run (either directly or through a menu) | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| An X or an O must appear on a box when that box is clicked | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| Your game must implement the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe: two players, X and O, take turns marking squares on a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols. If a player succeeds in placing three symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row, that player wins. If all the squares are filled without either player completing a row, the game is a draw. Both players can be human players: you do not need an AI opponent for this assignment | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| Have at least two screens: an in-game screen and another screen, such as a title screen | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| Clearly display which player’s turn it is | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| At the end of the game, effectively communicate which player won, or if it was a draw | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| Display the state of the game on a square board that scales with window size. The board must remain square at all times, no matter the window’s aspect ratio | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| Your game must implement keyboard events (e.g., exit game on escape) | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| Your game must never crash. | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |


## Secondary Requirements:
| Requirement | Location in code or steps to view in game  |
|---|---|
| Your engine must meet all primary engine requirements | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| Your buttons should display differently when they are hovered | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| Each player’s turn should have a time limit. If the player does not make a move when the time expires, it becomes the other player’s turn and the timer resets | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| Show the countdown timer (e.g., shrinking bar, text in seconds) | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
| It must be possible to start a new game without restarting the program | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |

## Extras:
| Requirement | Location in code or steps to view in game  |
|---|---|
| [Copy and paste from handout] | ```File path, function name, or steps to replicate``` |
